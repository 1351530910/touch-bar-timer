### Use Case

You are on meeting in Hangouts, Skype, or Slack. It's good practice to be on mute until someone ask you 
especialy when you are talking with 3 or more people. Also during a meeting you are browsing through the tabs and 
when someone ask you it takes a lot of time to switch back to right tab or app and unmute your microphone. 
With Mute Me you can easy to mute/unmute your microphone from your Touch Bar.
